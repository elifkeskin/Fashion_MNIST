**Project Name:** Fashion MNIST

**Project Description:** It provides a dataset of 70,000 black and white fashion images in 10 different clothing categories.

**Project Purpose:** Correctly classifying 10 different types of classes.

**Dataset:**

It is consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.

The dimensions of the images are 28*28 pixels.The format of the images is "png".

Each row is a separate image.

Column 1 is the class label.

Remaining columns are pixel numbers (784 total).

Each value is the darkness of the pixel (1 to 255)

**Labels**

Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

0 T-shirt/top

1 Trouser

2 Pullover

3 Dress

4 Coat

5 Sandal

6 Shirt

7 Sneaker

8 Bag

9 Ankle boot

**NOTE:** We will import the dataset from the dataset folder using the Keras module.

**Libraries We Will Use:**

**tensorflow:** It is an open source deep learning library.

**matplotlib:** It is a data visualization library.

**Project Steps:**

**1)** We will first pass the dataset through preprocessing steps.

**2)** We will choose a model architecture on the dataset and build the model.

**3)** We train the model.

**4)** We evaluate the model.
