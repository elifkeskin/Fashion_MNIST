# Fashion MNIST Classification

## 📝 Project Description

This project utilizes the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 black and white images of clothing items categorized into 10 different classes. The goal is to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

To correctly classify images into 10 different types of clothing categories using deep learning techniques.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Total Images:** 70,000 (60,000 training, 10,000 test)
- **Image Size:** 28x28 pixels (PNG format)
- **Data Format:**  
  - Each row represents a single image.
  - The first column is the class label.
  - The remaining 784 columns are pixel values (1 to 255) indicating the darkness of each pixel.

### Labels

| Label | Category      |
|-------|--------------|
| 0     | T-shirt/top  |
| 1     | Trouser      |
| 2     | Pullover     |
| 3     | Dress        |
| 4     | Coat         |
| 5     | Sandal       |
| 6     | Shirt        |
| 7     | Sneaker      |
| 8     | Bag          |
| 9     | Ankle boot   |

**Note:** The dataset will be imported from the dataset folder using the Keras module.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- **tensorflow:** Open-source deep learning library for building and training neural networks.
- **matplotlib:** Data visualization library for plotting images and results.

## 🚦 Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Load and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for model training.

2. **Model Building:**  
   Select an appropriate model architecture and build the neural network.

3. **Model Training:**  
   Train the model on the training dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation:**  
   Evaluate the model’s performance on the test dataset and visualize the results.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/elifkeskin/Fashion_MNIST.git
    cd Fashion_MNIST
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Project**
    - Open the main script or notebook and follow the steps to preprocess data, build, train, and evaluate the model.

## 📊 Example Visualization
   ```bash
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Example: Display a sample image
plt.imshow(X_train[0].reshape(28,28), cmap='gray')
plt.title(f"Label: {y_train[0]}")
plt.show()
    ```
